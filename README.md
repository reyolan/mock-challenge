# mock-challenge

Just a simple challenge to practice coding logic

## Getting started

To get started, clone the repo and access the created directory:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:reyolan/mock-challenge.git
$ cd mock-challenge
```

Run the test suite to verify that the class works correctly:

```
$ rspec
```

Test it manually with irb from the directory:

```
$ irb -b lib/label_maker.rb
```

If error occurs try this from the directory:

```
$ irb
$ require './lib/label_maker.rb'
```
